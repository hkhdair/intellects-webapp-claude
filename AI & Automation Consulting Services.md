AI & Automation Consulting Services
## Business Process Automation
Homepage Card Description: Streamline and automate your repetitive business tasks – from manual form
entries and data handling to intelligent chatbots and voice assistants. Free up your team’s time, reduce
errors, and accelerate workflows with custom automation solutions tailored to your needs (including
marketing and social media automation for retail clients).
## Overview
Business Process Automation is all about transforming tedious manual work into smooth, automated
workflows. We identify the routine tasks and bottlenecks in your operations and build smart automation
to handle them. This could mean automatically processing forms and data entries, integrating your CRM
with other systems so information flows without human input, or deploying AI-powered assistants to take
care of customer inquiries 24/7. The result is a faster, more efficient business where things “just happen” in
the background – letting you and your team focus on higher-value work.
As a specialized boutique consulting service, we take a personal approach to understanding your unique
processes. You’ll work directly with an experienced automation expert who will design solutions around
your business workflows (not a one-size-fits-all template). Whether you need an internal tool to eliminate
copy-paste tasks or a customer-facing chatbot to handle common questions, we can deliver a professional
solution that fits seamlessly. And for retail and marketing needs, we have you covered with automation for
social media scheduling, ad creative generation, and user-generated content workflows. In every case, our
goal is to save you time, cut out errors, and boost your productivity with confidence.
## What You Get
Time-Saving Workflows: Automated processes that execute in seconds, not hours – increasing
efficiency and freeing your staff from drudgery.
Error Reduction: Minimize manual data mistakes. By letting well-designed algorithms handle form
fills, data transfers, and calculations, you improve accuracy across the board.
Seamless System Integration: We connect your existing tools (CRM, databases, spreadsheets, etc.)
so they talk to each other automatically. No more exporting, importing, or duplicate data entry –
everything stays in sync.
AI Chatbots & Assistants: If needed, we deliver custom chatbots or voice agents to handle inquiries
or routine tasks. These intelligent assistants can serve customers or employees around the clock,
providing quick responses and reliable service.
Marketing Automation (Retail Focus): For clients in retail or e-commerce, we can set up
automations to schedule social media posts, manage email campaigns, generate ad creatives using
AI, and even curate user-generated content for you – all with minimal manual effort.

Personalized Service: A solution tailored precisely to your business. We don’t just drop in a generic
software – every automation is crafted to fit your workflows and goals. Plus, you’ll have direct access
to the consultant for any tweaks or questions along the way.
## Process & Tools
Process Analysis: We begin by mapping out your current workflows. Through a hands-on review
and discussions, we identify pain points, repetitive tasks, and opportunities where automation will
have the biggest impact.
Solution Design: Next, we design an automation strategy tailored to you. This includes choosing the
right tools for the job – from robotic process automation (RPA) software and APIs to custom scripts
or AI components. We outline how each piece will integrate with your systems and what the
workflow will look like after automation.
Development & Integration: Once the plan is approved, we build and implement the
automation. This might involve creating scripts or using automation platforms to perform tasks like
data transfer, setting up chatbots or voice assistants, and linking systems together. We integrate
these solutions into your existing environment (for example, connecting with your CRM, ERP, or
website).
Testing & Refinement: Before anything goes live, we rigorously test the automated workflows in
real-world scenarios. We verify that data is flowing correctly, the chatbot responds appropriately, and
each automation is reliable and secure. Any hiccups or edge cases are ironed out, ensuring the
solution works smoothly under real conditions.
Deployment & Training: After successful testing, we deploy the automation into your business
workflow. We don’t just flip the switch and walk away – we also train you and your team on how
everything works. You’ll receive clear instructions or demos on using any new tools (like a dashboard
to monitor the automation or update a chatbot’s FAQs). We make sure you’re comfortable and
confident with the new process.
Support & Follow-Up: We stand by our work. After deployment, we’ll be on hand to monitor the
initial run and answer any questions. If anything needs adjustment, we address it promptly. (And
remember, if you ever want ongoing support or further training, we offer that through our Training
& Support service.) Our goal is a smooth transition where the automation quietly does its job and
your team feels the difference in their day-to-day workload.
Tools we commonly use include secure automation scripts in Python, reputable RPA platforms, and AI services for
intelligent bots – always selecting the best fit for your specific needs. By using modern, proven technologies, we
ensure your automation is reliable and maintainable.
## Example Use Cases
Automatic Data Entry: For example, when a client fills out an online form, the data could instantly
flow into your CRM and trigger a follow-up email – no employee needed to retype information.
Invoice & Report Generation: Generate monthly reports or client invoices with one click. The
system gathers data from various sources (sales figures, time logs, etc.) and compiles it into a
formatted document automatically.
CRM and Database Sync: Keep customer records updated across platforms. If a new customer
registers on your website, their details auto-populate in your CRM, email marketing tool, and
accounting system so you don’t have to enter it multiple times.

AI Customer Service Chatbot: Deploy a chatbot on your website or Facebook page to answer
common customer questions (store hours, order status, FAQ) instantly. This bot can resolve issues or
collect information for a human follow-up, reducing the load on your support team.
Voice-Activated Assistant: Set up a voice assistant (think Alexa or Google Assistant style, but
custom) for your internal operations – for instance, a voice bot that field technicians can ask for stock
levels or that sales reps can use to log updates hands-free while on the road.
Retail Marketing Automation: Automate your marketing workflows – schedule social media posts
in advance, have AI generate draft ad creatives or product descriptions for your review, and
automatically collect user-generated content (like customer Instagram photos or reviews) into a
library for your marketing team to approve and use. This means less grunt work and more
consistent engagement with your audience.

Custom AI Solutions
Homepage Card Description: Leverage AI that’s tailor-made for your business. We fine-tune advanced
models using your data to solve specific challenges – from predictive analytics and forecasting to computer
vision, NLP, and more. Get end-to-end AI development (model training, evaluation, deployment) with full
compliance to Australian privacy laws, delivering insightful solutions unique to you.
## Overview
Sometimes off-the-shelf AI tools just don’t fit the bill. Our Custom AI Solutions service is about building AI
and machine learning models uniquely designed for your needs. Instead of a generic model, you get an
AI system trained on your data and aligned with your goals. This could involve predictive analytics (e.g.
forecasting sales, detecting trends, making data-driven predictions), computer vision tasks (like analyzing
images or video for specific insights), natural language processing (understanding and generating text,
powering smart chatbots or document analysis), or even educational tech like personalized tutoring
systems that adapt to each learner. If you have a business problem that data and AI might solve, we can
create a custom solution to tackle it head-on.
We handle the entire AI development lifecycle for you. From initial strategy and data preparation to
model training, evaluation, and deployment, we’ve got it covered. As a boutique consultancy led by a
single expert, we offer close, transparent collaboration: you’ll always know what’s happening with your
project and why. We’ll pick the right approach for your scenario – perhaps fine-tuning a state-of-the-art pre-
trained model (leveraging the latest in AI research) or developing a new algorithm from scratch – whatever
yields the best results. Crucially, we also ensure that any solution we build adheres to Australian privacy
laws and ethical guidelines. Your data stays secure and private, and the AI is developed with compliance
in mind (for example, respecting the Australian Privacy Principles for handling personal information). In
short, you get all the power of cutting-edge AI, delivered responsibly and customized to give you a
competitive edge.

## What You Get
Bespoke AI Model: A machine learning model crafted for your specific problem. Instead of forcing a
generic AI to do the job, we either build or fine-tune one that truly understands your data. This means
higher accuracy and relevance in the insights or predictions it provides.
End-to-End Project Delivery: We manage the whole process – defining the AI strategy, cleaning and
preparing your data, developing the model, testing it thoroughly, and deploying it into your
environment. You won’t have to worry about any technical steps; it’s all handled for you, with regular
updates at each stage.
Seamless Integration: The final AI solution won’t sit in a silo – we ensure it integrates with your
business workflow. Whether it’s accessed via a simple web application, an API that plugs into your
existing software, or a dashboard for your team, we’ll deliver the AI in a user-friendly format that
fits how you work.
Privacy & Compliance Assurance: Peace of mind comes standard. All our AI solutions are
developed with strict adherence to privacy regulations. We will advise on and implement measures
to protect personal or sensitive data (anonymization, secure storage, etc.), ensuring the solution is
compliant with Australian privacy laws.
Documentation & Training: You’ll receive clear documentation explaining how the AI solution works
from a user perspective (and technical details as needed). We also include a training session or
walkthrough for your team, so they know how to interpret the AI’s output and leverage it effectively
in decision-making.
Post-Deployment Support: Our commitment doesn’t end at launch. We offer support to monitor
the AI’s performance in real-world use and can adjust or retrain the model as your needs evolve. If
you opt for an ongoing support plan, we’ll continuously help maintain and improve the solution so it
keeps delivering value.
Cutting-Edge Techniques: By working with a specialist, you get access to the latest AI techniques
and tools. We select the most suitable technologies (e.g., deep learning neural networks, NLP
transformers, computer vision frameworks) to maximize results for your project – essentially giving
you an “in-house AI R&D” capability on a flexible basis.
## Process & Tools
Discovery & Planning: We start by discussing your goals and brainstorming potential AI solutions.
What business question are you trying to answer or what task do you want to improve with AI? We’ll
identify the use case, the success criteria (e.g. accuracy targets, speed, etc.), and review what data
you have available. At this stage, we also consider feasibility: ensuring that an AI approach makes
sense and will deliver ROI for your specific problem.
Data Assessment & Preparation: Data is the backbone of any AI. We’ll audit the data you have –
whether it’s spreadsheets, databases, images, text, or all of the above – to understand quality and
coverage. Then we get to work cleaning and preparing it. This could involve formatting data
consistently, handling missing information, or combining data from multiple sources. We also
address privacy here: for instance, anonymizing personal identifiers or securing sensitive
information, so we can train the model in compliance with privacy standards.
Model Development: Next, we choose the right modeling approach. Sometimes that means fine-
tuning a pre-existing model (for example, using transfer learning on a model like GPT for language
or ResNet for vision, adapting it to your data). Other times, it means creating a custom model from
scratch using machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. In all cases, we leverage
proven AI techniques suited to your problem – be it regression, classification, clustering, deep

learning, etc. – and train the model on your data. This step is iterative and hands-on: we
experiment with different model architectures or parameters to find what works best.
Evaluation & Refinement: Building the model is half the battle; making sure it works in the real
world is the other half. We rigorously evaluate the model using test data and simulation of real use
cases. You’ll see metrics and results in understandable terms – how accurate is the prediction, how
well does the AI detect the right images or understand text, etc. We also check for any biases or
errors. If the model isn’t meeting the agreed criteria, we go back and improve it (tweaking the data,
the model, or the training process) until it does. Quality and reliability are paramount before we
proceed to deployment.
Deployment: With a successful model in hand, we deploy it in a way that you can use day-to-day.
Depending on your needs, this could mean setting up a cloud service where the model is hosted and
accessible via an API, integrating it into an existing application (for instance, adding the AI to your
software or website), or creating a simple user interface for non-technical users to interact with the
model. We take care of all the technical deployment steps, ensuring the AI runs efficiently in the
chosen environment (cloud, on-premises servers, etc.) and that it can scale as usage grows.
Handover & Team Training: After deployment, we don’t just hand you a complex system and
disappear. We walk you through the solution, explaining how it works in plain language. If it’s a
dashboard or app, we show your team how to use it, interpret results, and what to do if certain
situations arise (for example, if the AI isn’t confident in an answer). We give you documentation that
outlines the key points and also any maintenance guidelines. By the end of this step, your team
should feel comfortable with the new AI and excited by the insights it provides.
Ongoing Monitoring & Maintenance: AI models may require updates over time – perhaps your
data changes, or you want to expand functionality. We offer ongoing support to keep the AI model
up-to-date. This can include monitoring its performance (to catch any drift or drop in accuracy),
retraining the model periodically with new data, and updating the system as needed. Because you’re
working with a dedicated expert (the same person who built the model), any issues or new ideas can
be addressed quickly and knowledgeably. This ensures your custom AI solution continues to deliver
strong results in the long run.
Throughout this process, we use a range of professional tools: from programming languages like Python and R, to
ML libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn), and cloud AI services when appropriate (such as AWS, GCP, or Azure
machine learning tools). We’ll choose the stack that best fits your project’s needs. Our development approach also
emphasizes   transparency   –   we   can   periodically   demo   progress   and   gather   your   feedback   to   make   sure   the
solution is on the right track.
## Example Use Cases
Sales Forecasting: A retailer or wholesaler can have a custom AI model that analyzes historical sales
data, economic indicators, and even Google Trends to predict upcoming demand. This helps in
optimizing inventory and staffing with more accuracy than simple spreadsheets, reducing
overstock or stockouts.
Customer Churn Prediction: Using predictive analytics on customer behavior data, an AI solution
could identify which of your clients are likely to leave or stop buying. This gives you a chance to
proactively reach out with targeted offers or support to retain them.
Image-Based Quality Control: In manufacturing or production, a computer vision system can be
trained to inspect product images (or use camera feeds on the line) to detect defects or quality
issues instantly. For example, an AI might catch a tiny flaw in a product that human inspectors might
miss, ensuring only top-quality items go out.

Document Processing (NLP): Imagine you receive hundreds of forms or emails daily – a custom
NLP model could read and categorize them, extract key information, and route each to the right
department or trigger the right action. Whether it’s scanning legal documents for clauses, analyzing
support emails for urgent topics, or summarizing long reports, AI can understand text at high speed.
AI Knowledge Assistant: We could create a chatbot or voice assistant fine-tuned on your company’s
own knowledge base and data. For instance, your customer support team could query this assistant
for quick answers about products or policies, or customers could interact with it on your website to
get personalized advice. This isn’t a generic chatbot, but one that truly “knows” your business.
Personalized Tutoring System: In an educational context (EdTech), a custom AI can power a
tutoring platform that adapts to each student’s learning pace. For example, the AI would provide
easier or more detailed explanations when a student struggles with a concept, or advance to harder
challenges once it detects the student has mastered the current material. This leads to a tailored
learning experience far beyond a one-size-fits-all curriculum.
Recommendation Engine: If you run an e-commerce or content platform, we can develop a
recommendation system that suggests products or content to users based on their behavior and
preferences. Unlike off-the-shelf recommenders, this one would factor in the unique aspects of your
business and customers. The outcome is improved customer engagement and potentially higher
sales, thanks to highly relevant recommendations.

## Training & Support
Homepage Card Description: Ensure your team fully benefits from new AI and automation solutions. We
provide hands-on training, user-friendly documentation, and ongoing support so that adopting AI is a
smooth, positive experience. From onboarding and change management to long-term maintenance, we
help your people embrace the technology with confidence.
## Overview
Implementing AI and automation is not just a technical project – it’s a people project. Our Training &
Support service is designed to help your team adopt new solutions comfortably and effectively. We
know that introducing a chatbot, an automated workflow, or an AI tool can be a big change in how people
work day-to-day. That’s why we focus on comprehensive onboarding and change management. In practice,
this means we offer customized training sessions (in plain language, at the right pace for your staff) and we
address any concerns or adjustments needed as your processes evolve. The goal is to ensure everyone
understands the tool, trusts it, and knows how to use it to make their work easier, not harder.
Beyond the initial handover, we stand by to support you for the long haul. Questions might come up after a
week, or you might need a tweak to the system a few months down the line – we’ll be there to help. Because
this is a boutique consulting offering, the same expert who built your solution is the one supporting
your team. You won’t be stuck in a generic helpdesk queue or handed off to someone new. This continuity

means faster, more knowledgeable support whenever you need it. Ultimately, Training & Support ensures
that the investment you made in AI or automation pays off fully: your team will actually use the tools
correctly and enthusiastically, and you’ll have peace of mind that maintenance and updates are taken care
of.
## What You Get
Customized Training Program: We develop training tailored to your team’s needs. This could be
hands-on workshops, live demos, or one-on-one coaching sessions – whatever format works best for
your organization. Your employees will learn exactly how to use the new AI/automation tools in the
context of their daily tasks.
Change Management Assistance: Introducing automation can be a culture shift. We help craft a
change management plan that prepares your staff for what’s coming. This includes clear
communication about the benefits (and addressing the “fear of the unknown”), so everyone is on
board and excited rather than anxious. We essentially act as your partner in making the transition as
smooth as possible.
User-Friendly Documentation: Say goodbye to dense technical manuals. We provide clear, concise
documentation for your solution – think step-by-step guides with screenshots, FAQs for common
questions, and troubleshooting tips. This reference material is customized to your implemented
system, meaning your team can quickly find answers even after training sessions are over.
Post-Launch Handholding: In the days and weeks right after the new system goes live, we’re readily
available to support you. If an employee isn’t sure how to do something or if a minor issue arises,
we’ll be on call to assist. This immediate support during the critical adoption phase helps build
confidence and keeps momentum going.
Long-Term Maintenance: Technology works best when kept up-to-date. We offer long-term support
options where we routinely check in on your AI/automation solution, apply updates or
improvements, and ensure it continues to run securely and efficiently. You can choose a support
plan that fits your level of need – whether it’s occasional check-ups or a more active maintenance
schedule.
Direct Access to Expertise: Whenever you have questions or requests, you’ll be talking to the
expert who knows your project inside-out. There’s no bouncing between departments. This
personal, reliable support means you don’t have to re-explain your system every time – we already
know you and your solution, allowing us to help immediately and effectively.
## Process & Tools
Needs Assessment: First, we evaluate the landscape. Who will be using the new AI or automation,
and what is their skill level? We identify key user groups (e.g., your customer service team for a new
chatbot, or your analysts for a new AI dashboard) and gauge their comfort with similar technology.
We also pinpoint any potential challenges or resistance – for example, are team members worried
the AI will replace their job, or are they excited to offload boring tasks? This helps us tailor our
training and communication appropriately.
Training Plan Design: Based on the assessment, we create a training and support plan. This plan
covers what format the training will take (classroom-style workshops, virtual webinars, one-on-one
mentoring, etc.), when it will happen (timing it close to the tool’s launch so it’s fresh, but also
staggered if needed for different shifts or locations), and what materials will be provided. We also
develop a change management strategy here – essentially, how to introduce the new tool to the

## 7

team, get buy-in, and keep everyone informed. This might include kickoff meetings, email
announcements, or champion users who lead by example.
Training Delivery: Now the fun part – teaching and empowering your team. We conduct the training
sessions as planned, making sure to keep things interactive and relevant. Rather than abstract tech
talk, we use your actual use cases in demonstrations. For instance, if it’s a workflow automation, we’ll
show the exact process your team does and how it’s now automated; if it’s an AI analytics tool, we’ll
walk through interpreting its output on your real data. Participants are encouraged to ask questions
and even try the tool themselves during training (with us guiding). The aim is for everyone to walk
out of training feeling confident and ready to use the new solution.
Documentation & Resources: Alongside live training, we provide easy-to-follow documentation.
At this stage, we’ll hand over things like user guides, quick reference sheets, and any tutorial videos
if we’ve made them. These resources cover the step-by-step of common tasks and also
troubleshooting for minor issues. They’re written in plain language and formatted for quick reading.
Think of this as the safety net – if someone forgets how to do something, they have a guide to refer
to anytime. We can also include an internal FAQ that addresses specific questions your team asked
during training.
Go-Live Support: When your AI or automation solution goes live (whether it’s a big launch or a
gradual roll-out), we’ll be on standby. This means for a period of time (let’s say the first few weeks of
use), we make ourselves readily available via your preferred channels (phone, email, chat) to answer
“How do I...?” questions or resolve any hiccups. We can even be on-site (if feasible) during the launch
day to walk the floor and assist in person. The idea is to ensure the launch period is smooth and that
any small obstacles are immediately cleared, so the team’s first impression of using the tool remains
positive.
Ongoing Support & Maintenance: After the initial adoption phase, you have the option to continue
with a support agreement for the long term. If chosen, this means we’ll periodically check in on your
system’s health (making sure an automation script hasn’t stopped or that your AI model is still
performing well). We’ll also be just a call or email away whenever you need help or want to make an
enhancement. For example, maybe six months in, you want to add a new feature or adjust a
workflow – we can schedule that in and implement it. Our ongoing support is very flexible: it’s like
having an AI/automation expert on retainer. Because we already know your setup, we can jump in
and sort things out quickly, minimizing downtime or disruption.
In   terms   of   tools,   our   “training   toolbox”   might   include   presentation   platforms   for   live   demos,   screen-sharing
software for remote sessions, and learning materials hosted on a simple internal site or shared drive for your
team. We can also set up support channels (like a dedicated Slack or Teams channel) for quick Q&A. Everything is
geared towards making knowledge transfer easy and keeping lines of communication open.
## Example Use Cases
Onboarding a Sales Team to an AI-CRM: After implementing an AI-powered CRM that scores leads
and suggests follow-up actions, we conduct training for the sales team. We show them how the AI
generates lead scores, how to prioritize their outreach based on those scores, and how to use the
automated email features. We address questions like “What if the AI score seems wrong?” and
ensure the team trusts the new system. Post-training, the salespeople feel excited that they can
focus more on selling and less on data entry.
Customer Support Chatbot Handover: Suppose we built a customer service chatbot for your
company. In training, we work with your support staff to explain the chatbot’s capabilities and limits.
We teach them how to monitor conversations, when to intervene and take over from the bot, and
## 3.
## 4.
## 5.
## 6.
## •
## •
## 8

how to feed new Q&A pairs into the bot’s knowledge base over time. By the end, your support team
sees the chatbot as a helpful colleague rather than a threat – they know it will handle the easy
questions and hand off the tougher ones to them.
Marketing Team Upskilling for Automation: Let’s say your marketing department now has an AI
tool that auto-generates social media posts or ad copy suggestions. We provide a workshop for the
marketing team where they learn how to use the tool’s interface, how to review and edit the AI’s
content to ensure it fits the brand voice, and how to set up automated campaigns. We also cover
best practices for mixing AI-generated creative with human creativity. The team comes away with
new skills and a comfort level in using AI to amplify their marketing efforts.
Process Automation in Operations (Change Management): Perhaps we introduced a robotic
process automation in a finance department to handle invoice processing. Some staff might worry
about their roles. We not only train them on overseeing the RPA bot and handling exceptions, but
also engage in change management – having discussions about how their roles can evolve to more
analytical work now that the bot handles the routine stuff. Over a few sessions, the team shifts from
skepticism to seeing the automation as a tool that makes their jobs less tedious, with us supporting
that mindset change.
Educational AI Tool for Teachers: If a school adopted a new AI-driven personalized learning
platform, we would work with the teachers to train them on interpreting the AI’s feedback on
student performance. For example, if the AI flags that a student struggles with a particular math
concept and dynamically adjusts the curriculum, we show the teacher how to view those insights
and use them to give targeted help. We remain available through the first semester as teachers
incorporate the tool into their lesson planning. This ensures the educators feel confident and can
seamlessly blend the AI system into their teaching process.
