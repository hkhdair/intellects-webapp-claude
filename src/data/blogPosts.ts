## Getting Started with AI Automation

Implementing AI automation doesn't have to be overwhelming. Start with these steps:

1. **Identify Pain Points**: Evaluate which manual processes consume the most time and resources
2. **Start Small**: Begin with one or two automation projects to demonstrate value
